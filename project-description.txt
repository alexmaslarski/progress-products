The purpose of the project was to visualise a list of products.

In order to fit in with the technologies used by Progress, I decided to use Angular, which I have very little experience with.
At first I created a very simple app and then started improving it by using KendoUI (You can see my progress in GitHub).
It was the first time I've used KendoUI and found it a bit confusing at first, but after going through some parts of the
docs I managed to implement it into my solution.

My solution consists of two components - the main one and one containing kendoUI's grid, which uses the data passed in by
a products.ts file containing all products. (This can easily be fetched by a server in order to make it dynamic.)

Overall I think I found myself around Angular and KendoUI relatively fast, the only troubles I had was with
[rowClass] which didn't seem to do anything, despite doing everything as stated in the docs. It turned out to be a problem
with my live server not compiling all resources properly. 

Some feedback about kendoUI's docs:
Generally I think they are quite well structured, but I think some parts of the Angular docs are lacking examples,
which are available in the JQuery docs for example.
